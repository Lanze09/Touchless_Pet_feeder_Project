I am doing a an automatic pet feeder project, which motor is better to use, the 28BYJ-48 or the micro servo 9g SG90?

The choice of motor depends on the specific requirements of your project. Here are some factors to consider for each motor:

28BYJ-48: This motor is a small stepper motor that is low cost and easy to control with a driver board. It has a high gear reduction ratio, which makes it suitable for applications that require high torque but low speed, such as turning a feeder wheel. However, it may not be as precise as a servo motor, which could affect the accuracy of the amount of food dispensed.

Micro servo 9g SG90: This motor is a small, low-cost servo motor that is commonly used in hobby projects. It has good positional accuracy, which makes it suitable for applications that require precise movement, such as opening and closing a lid. However, it may not have as much torque as a stepper motor, which could limit its ability to turn a feeder wheel.

Ultimately, the choice of motor depends on the specific requirements of your project. If you need high torque and don't require precise movement, the 28BYJ-48 might be a better choice. If you need precise movement and don't require as much torque, the SG90 might be a better choice.

I'm planning to use the motor for opening and closing the dispenser, which do you think is the most suitable for that?

Both the 28BYJ-48 and the micro servo 9g SG90 can be used for opening and closing the dispenser.

The 28BYJ-48 is a geared stepper motor that can provide precise control over the rotation angle, making it suitable for applications where accuracy is important. However, it may not have enough torque to rotate the dispenser if it is heavy or there is a lot of resistance.

On the other hand, the micro servo 9g SG90 has more torque compared to the 28BYJ-48, which makes it better suited for applications that require more force, such as rotating a heavier dispenser or overcoming resistance. However, it may not be as precise in controlling the rotation angle as the 28BYJ-48.

Overall, it depends on the specific requirements of your project. If precision is more important, you can use the 28BYJ-48. If you need more force or torque, you can use the micro servo 9g SG90.
