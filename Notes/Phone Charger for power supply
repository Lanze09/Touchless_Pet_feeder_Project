Yes, you can use a phone charger as a power source for your Arduino Uno board. However, there are some things you should keep in mind.

First, make sure that the phone charger you are using is rated for the correct voltage and amperage that your Arduino Uno board requires. The Arduino Uno board requires a power supply of 5 volts, with a recommended range of 7-12 volts, and can draw up to 1 ampere of current.

Secondly, ensure that the charger you are using provides a stable and clean power supply. Some low-quality phone chargers may produce unstable voltage and introduce electrical noise, which can cause malfunctions or damage to your Arduino Uno board.

In general, it's recommended to use a regulated power supply with a stable voltage output, such as a DC power adapter or a battery pack, instead of relying on a phone charger. However, if you need a quick and temporary power solution, a phone charger can work as long as you make sure it meets the requirements mentioned above.
